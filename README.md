# Introduction to remote collaborations
This repository is meant to explain who remote collaborations are done using git and github infrastructure under a **fork and contribute** model. It has a simple exercise that allows provides an introduction to markdown styling conventions to write simple documents. The exercise can be completed entirely through the github web infrastructure without using a git commands. The purpose is to demonstrate basic concepts of communication through issues page, forking, creating new commits/branches, and then sending a pull request for the repository owner to review the changes and if they like, merge them with their own repository. 

Here are some basic introduction to the how collaborations work in open-source projects in github. 
1. A very broad view of fork and contribute model (look only the section called **Fork and Pull**): http://www.goring.org/resources/project-management.html

Here is also a simple guide to Markdown syntax, which you will need for the exercise: https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/
Keep in mind in Markdown you can use any valid HTML syntax (such as embedding images in documents). 

Finally, a URL to an image, which you will need to complete the exercise described below: https://github.com/SlicerMorph/SlicerPhotogrammetry/blob/master/Photogrammetry/Resources/Icons/Photogrammetry.png
